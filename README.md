# **ADEV SUBSCRIPTION APP**
## Description

- This plartform allows users to subscribe to channels on a decentralized network. Users can pay a subscription fee, 
to access exclusive content or services provided by channel creators.
- Cairo is used for creating smart contracts and StarkNet provides the infrastructure for running these contracts efficiently on a Layer 2 blockchain.
- This ensures secure and scalable subscription management, enabling channel creators to offer their content or services while users enjoy a seamless and decentralized subscription experience.

## How it works

- The user logs in using the wallet which will give out the permission to fully access the application (N/B: The user won't be able to access the app if they don't have
a wallet).
- After successfull connection of the wallet with the application, the user will click on the *Add Package* button then Type in the package title, 
the Price and the number of channel the click on *+ Add Package* button after which the wallet prompt will come up for you to *confirm* or *cancel* the transaction.
- In attempt to confirm the transaction the package will be added to the *Subscription Channel* page where the user will then be able to select the package watch over the channels.
