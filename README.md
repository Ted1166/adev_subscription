This plartform allows users to subscribe to channels on a decentralized network. Users can pay a subscription fee, 
to access exclusive content or services provided by channel creators. Cairo is used for creating smart contracts and StarkNet 
provides the infrastructure for running these contracts efficiently on a Layer 2 blockchain. This ensures secure and scalable subscription management, 
enabling channel creators to offer their content or services while users enjoy a seamless and decentralized subscription experience.
